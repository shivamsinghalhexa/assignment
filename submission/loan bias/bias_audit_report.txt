2. Regulatory Compliance:
GDPR Article 22 Compliance (Excerpt):
- Individuals have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them.
- The model implements automated decision-making with human oversight. Applicants have the right to request human intervention. Clear explanation of the decision-making process is provided.

ECOA Guidelines Compliance (Excerpt):
- Prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of gender and other protected characteristics.
- Model is regularly audited for disparate impact. Demographic parity constraints are implemented. Transparent documentation of approval criteria.

3. Mitigation Strategies:
a) Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Implement balanced sampling across gender groups. Regular monitoring of feature distributions. Periodic retraining with updated data.

b) Model Training:
- Add demographic parity constraints during training. Use reweighting techniques to balance the training data. Implement post-processing techniques to adjust predictions.

c) Monitoring and Maintenance:
- Regular fairness audits. Continuous monitoring of approval rates by gender. Periodic model retraining with updated fairness constraints.

4. Key Findings:
- Demographic Parity Difference: 0.026
- Gender-based approval rate disparities exist in the model
- False positive and false negative rates vary by gender
- Model shows potential bias in loan approval decisions
